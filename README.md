**Technique of logistic regression for predicting cardiovascular disease**

Cardiovascular illness is among the most lethal conditions. Its high mortality rate is responsible for roughly 17 million deaths worldwide. Early detection enables prompt treatment of the condition to avert fatality. There are several machine learning and deep learning algorithms available for classifying the disease's presence or absence. In this project, Logistic Regression (LR) techniques are used to classify heart illness using the UCI dataset




We achieved 88% accuracy, which is a positive indicator. We could enhance them by tweaking their hyperparameters more.
