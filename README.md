**Technique of logistic regression for predicting cardiovascular disease**

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. However, people with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

This machine learning model could help in estimating the probability of deaths caused by heart failure by taking in important features from the dataset and making predictions based on these features


We achieved 88% accuracy, which is a positive indicator. We could enhance them by tweaking their hyperparameters more.

1. age: The person's age in years
2. sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
3. cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)
4. trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
6. fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)
8. thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)
12. ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)
13. thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)
14. target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
